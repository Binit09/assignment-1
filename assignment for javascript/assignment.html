        <h1>Difference between Let and Var.</h1>
        <p>var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped. it can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compiled
            to let.

        <h1>Why are null,array printed in object type in console.</h1>
        <p>
            The value null is written with a literal: null. null is not an identifier for a property of the global object, like undefined can be. Instead, null expresses a lack of identification, indicating that a variable points to no object. In APIs, null is often
            retrieved in a place where an object can be expected but no object is relevant.
